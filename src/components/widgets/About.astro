						We are a small group of crypto enthusiasts who have been in the space for several years. My name is Nic Neon
						and I am a developer and the founder of Crypto Security Tools. I have seen many people lose their crypto due
						to hacks, theft, and lost seed words. I have also seen people lose their crypto due to not having a proper
						backup of their seed words.<br /><br />
						Our mission: to help as many people as possible upgrade their wallet security and to promote self-custody.<br

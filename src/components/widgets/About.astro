						We are a small group of crypto enthusiasts who have been in the space for several years. My name is Nic Neon
						and I am a developer and the founder of the Crypto Security Tools. I have seen many people lose their crypto
						due to hacks, theft, and lost seed words. I have also seen people lose their crypto due to not having a
						proper backup of their seed words. Our mission is to help as many people as possible upgrade their wallet
						security and to promote self-custody. Not your keys, not your crypto.<br /><br /><a

					<p class="mb-2 text-xl font-bold">Why Another Backup Solution?</p>
					<p class="">
						The BIP39 word list is used almost exclusively by most software and hardware wallets. Many people don't
						obfuscate their seed words or encrypt them. This is a huge security risk. If someone gets a hold of your
						seed words, they can steal all your crypto. We designed a simple solution that allows you to create a
						hardened backup of your seed words for cold storage. Importantly it had to be simple to use. Our backup
						system works with any wallet that uses BIP39 seed words. You can also use this method in addition to a
						cryptosteel or billfodl.

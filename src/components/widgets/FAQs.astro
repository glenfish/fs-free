			question: 'How do I know if I can create a hardened backup of my wallet?',
			answer: `

This system creates hardened backups of any HD crypto wallet that uses the BIP39 standard. This includes wallets like Ledger, Trezor, and many others. If you aren't sure, search for your wallet name and "BIP39" to see if it uses this standard.
.`,
		},
		{
			question: 'Which wallets are not supported?',
			answer: `SLIP39 is not supported. Trezor offers a version of their Model T which uses SLIP39 and it is not compatible with this system.`,
		},
		{
			question: 'How can I trust you?',
			answer: `No trust is required. The steps are clearly explained and you are the one carrything them out, on your own computer, offline. In fact we deliberately designed this system to be trust-less. You can even restore your wallet without using any special tools. Simply unlock the seedmap with your password and manually match your seed codes to the BIP39 word list.`,
		},
		{
			question: 'Is this totally an offline cold storage backup solution?',
			answer: `Yes, if you choose to follow the directions as given, you can create a backup of your wallet that never touches the internet. The system is designed to be used offline. There is however an optional method which allows you to store your seedcodes across multiple encrypted cloud storage locations. This is helpful if you want to be able to update the backup in the future without having to retrieve all the USB drives first. It is just as secure as the offline method, and more convenient. It's up to you which method you choose.`,
		},
		{
			question: 'Is this free?',
			answer: `Yes, the actual system outlined here and in the PDF (if you choose to download it) is free of charge. Our mission is to help as many people in the crypto community as possible to secure their assets.`,
		},
		{
			question: 'Is there a paid version?',
			answer: `We do have a fully offline version of the system that will be available for purchase at a later date. It runs simply in the browser, and does not require any internet connection. It dramatically speeds up the backup and restore process, and is designed for those who have a large number of wallets to backup, or who just want a turnkey tool to do the job.`,
		},
		{
			question: 'Why did you create this system? Do I really need it?',
			answer: `Many people don't
						obfuscate their seed words, or encrypt them. They simply hide them and hope nobody finds them. This is a huge security risk. As you know, should someone get hold of your
						seed words, they can steal your assets. We designed a simple solution that allows you to create a
						hardened backup of your seed words for cold storage. Importantly it had to be simple to use. Our backup
						system works with any wallet that uses BIP39 seed words. You can also use this method in addition to a
						cryptosteel or billfodl.`,
